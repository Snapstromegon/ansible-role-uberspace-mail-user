# Ansible Role: uberspace-mail-user

This is part of the uberspace roles collection.

This is meant to be used on your [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/).

Please be aware, that I'm neither part of the Uberspace team, nor am I associated to them other than having some Uberspaces myself.
This project was created, because I wanted to use the roles for myself and thought they were okay-ish enough to share them.

## What is this (from the uberspace manual)

You can use mailboxes in the form of $MAILBOX@$USER.uber.space. If you have set up additional domains, $MAILBOX@$DOMAIN will also work.

You can find the documentation of the replaced tool `uberspace mail user` in the Uberspace Manual [here](https://manual.uberspace.de/mail-mailboxes.html).

## Notes

Because I didn't yet find out how to solve idempotency, this role currently doesn't support changing a users password!

I'll try to add this in the future. If you have an idea, feel free to contribute in .
